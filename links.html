            Watch my intro on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DZ0wBjFKg4" target="_blank">How To / Why Make Internet Art</a> for an introduction to the theoretical framework we'll be using to approach our subject matter throughout this course. If you haven't already, make sure to review the syllabus and watch my video on it (both of which are linked on the homepage) and answer the survey questions I sent to the entire class via email.

          <h3>Online Communities</h3>
          <p>
            In 1968, when the first two computers came online and before “online” meant anything to anyone, two of the Internet’s creators wrote, “life will be happier for the online individual because the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity.” In 1973 email was the “killer app”; today it’s social media. From BBSs (Bulletin Board Systems) of the 1980s to subreddits today, the Internet has always been about community.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997, <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Netizens%3A+On+the+History+and+Impact+of+Usenet+and+the+Internet-p-9780818677069" target="_blank">Michael and Ronda Hauben wrote</a> that, "a new world of connections between people—either privately, from individual to individual, or publicly, from individuals to the collective mass of many on the Net—is possible. The old model of distribution of information from the central Network Broadcasting Company is being questions and challenged. The top-down model of information being distributed by a few for mass consumption is no longer the only news. Netnews brings the power of the report to the Netizen. People now have the ability to broadcast their observations or questions around the world and have other people respond. The computer networks form a new grassroots connection that allows excluded sections of society to have a voice. This new medium is unprecedented." At the time, this was meant to feel utopian, today 20 years later, amid the onslaught of mis/disinformation we're facing, it reads almost dystopian.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does the Internet help bring the world together, to "consider everyone as [our] compatriot" (Hauben) in a "global village" (Marshall McLuhan)? Or is it splitting us apart into warring tribes, each living in our own virtual realities? Does the Internet's decentralized nature challenge conventional control structures and give the power to the people? Or could the further dismantling of the old hierarchical information systems lead to chaos, confusion and the end of democracy?
